Receives mechanical engineering problems from the green agent and solves them using available tools (calculator, python_exec). 

The agent handles multiple problem types:
- Level A: Multiple choice questions requiring analysis and reasoning
- Level B: Calculation problems requiring numerical answers with units
- Level C: Design problems requiring JSON output with design parameters, rationale, and verification code
- Level D: Multi-step design problems requiring system-level design decisions

All responses must use tools for calculations before providing final answers, and must be formatted as JSON wrapped in <json>...</json> tags for tool calls, or as ```json code blocks for final design responses.

Solve this mechanical engineering problem:

**Problem:**
A cantilever beam with length L = 1.0 m, width b = 0.05 m, and height h = 0.20 m is made of steel (E = 210 GPa, ρ = 7850 kg/m³). A point load P = 100 N is applied at the free end.

Calculate the maximum deflection at the free end.

**Available tools:**
- calculator: Perform arithmetic calculations
- python_exec: Execute Python code for complex calculations

**Response format:**
Use tools to calculate, then provide your final answer in JSON format:
<json>
{"name": "respond", "kwargs": {"content": "The maximum deflection is X.XX m."}}
</json>
